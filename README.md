## pastebin-raw-text

This is a simple Chrome extension that watches for pastebin.com URLs, and
if it looks like a request for a paste, redirects the user to the raw
format.

For example:

<http://pastebin.com/FHqpUyyv>

automatically redirects to:

<http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FHqpUyyv>

This avoids obnoxious adverts, distracting pages, duplicate text, and gives
users just what they need - the plain text!

### Installation

This extension is available in the [Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pastebin-raw-text/madpgppmbhecemnaicfpkokbookighmg).

Alternatively you can clone this repository then point at the checked out
directory from __Settings -> Extensions -> Load unpackaged extension__ (you'll
need to have checked "Developer mode" to enable unpackaged installation).
