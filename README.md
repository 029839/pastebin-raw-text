## pastebin-raw-text

This is a simple Chrome extension that watches for pastebin.com URLs, and
if it looks like a request for a paste, redirects the user to the raw
format.

For example:

<http://pastebin.com/FHqpUyyv>

automatically redirects to:

<http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=FHqpUyyv>

This avoids obnoxious adverts, distracting pages, duplicate text, and gives
users just what they need - the plain text!

### Installation

I haven't done anything fancy like uploading it to the Chrome Store and
design fancy icons, so for now just clone this repository, switch Chrome
Extensions into "Developer mode" and point "Load unpacked extension" at
this checkout.
